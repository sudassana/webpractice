<h2>About Data Visualisation</h2>
<p>So, this assignment is required us to to some analysis from the Australian Census from 2011 and 2016. In order for us to represent the data from the Census, we retrieved the datapacks in form of .csv and .shp files from Australian Bureau of Statistics and process it through QGIS. The processed data from QGIS then exported into Mapbox, an open source mapping platform. The sector we were chosen was B15 (for 2011) and G15 (for 2016). This map is divided by post code (labeled POA_CODE), and for processing it, we added the % difference of University students from 2011 to 2016 (labeled uni_diff) and the proportion of University students in 2016 (labeled uni_prop).In Mapbox, we created a 3d extrusion for a better view, in which the color-fill is based on <i>uni_diff</i> (low/red - high/green) and height extrusion based on <i>uni_prop</i>.<br><br>Click 'Mapbox' in the navigation bar above to take a look at it. </p>


<h3>What is Census?</h3>
<p>The Australian Census is the largest form of information collecting conducted every 5 years by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). From the data it collected, it can tell the current situation such as population, income, immigration, etc. The gathered data then compiled based on the Australian Standard Geographica Classification (ASGS) which are: Statistical Area (SA1), SA2, SA3, SA4, State/Territory, and Australia.

<h5>Analysis</h5>
<p class="par5">
For column chart (1), it shows the least 10 of uni_diff. It shows that POA2231 has the least uni_diff in the whole data. Although the graph shows that each of them has significant difference. But the data shows that the POA2231 and POA2023’s number are very closed.<br><br>
For column chart (2), it shows the least 10 of uni_prop. The POA2231 has the least uni_prop in the whole area. Although all the least 10 areas have increase proportion. But all of them are very similar. Area POA2231 are much less than second last POA2233. And other 9 area’s data are much similar with each other.<br><br>
For column chart (3), it shows the least 10 of uni_total in 2016. The chart figures out that POA2231 has the least total in 2016. It can be easily figured out that area POA2231 has the least total in the whole data. And POA2231 are much less than second last POA2225. It less than POA2225 approximately 233.<br><br>
For column chart (4), it shows the top 10 of uni_prop. The chart figures out that POA2052 has the maximum uni_prop in the whole data. It shows that area POA2052 has the highest proportion in the whole data. The whole graph shows that there is a significant difference between POA2006 and POA2008. After POA2008, each area data is similar with each other.<br><br>
For column chart (5), it shows the top 10 of uni_tot in 2016. The chart figures out that POA2032 has the maximum uni_tot in 2016. The area POA2032 has the highest total in 2016. The significant difference between POA2220 and POA2000. The left four columns data are much similar. The right four columns data are much similar.<br><br>
For column chart (6),it shows the top 10 of uni_diff. The chart figures out that POA2008 has the biggest change in the whole data. The highest difference is area POA2008. This graph shows that the trend was decreased sharply. The first area has an enormous difference with the last one.<br><br><br></p>

<h6>Conclusion</h6>
<p class="par6">From the 3D visualisation of Mapbox and the analysis charts, we can conclude that there are significants changes of University students number during 2011 to 2016. For example in chart 6, it shows that the highest number is located in NSW 2052. That location direct us to UNSW, which is one of the most popular University in New South Wales. Furthermore, it seems that many students living outside the city began to spread in the Sydney CBD area, with the reason of living near their campus for convenience. In addition, this could be also influenced by the number of international students coming to NSW. However, since we don't get the chance to analyse the number of international visitors from the census, we do not have a certainty. </p>
